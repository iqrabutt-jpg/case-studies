                That's exactly what I thought in December 2024, while telling the Tiffin Box POC about the DAC7 form. He listened carefully and simply said, "Boss is not here." I would find out many months later that he was actually the owner.
            </p>
            <p>
                With plenty of innate stubbornness, I began a new ritual: showing up at their doorstep every other week for the next nine months. The partner would promise to fill in the form as soon as I left, and I would pretend to believe them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally on August 18th, I waltzed into the restaurant and as usual, the partner seemed amused to see me, but asked for the first time ever, "What was that form you mentioned last time?" No professional achievement will ever be as satisfying as filling in that DAC7 form with the partner, while standing next to delicious Indian food.
            </p>
            <p>
                That evening, I had two epiphanies. First, their chicken tikka is actually delicious; second, this is what we do as Territory Managers (TMs) in Core London: we keep showing up for our partners. We show up in the freezing cold of December and during the heatwaves of summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                As long as TMs are on the streets, partners like Tiffin Box are really not going anywhere.
